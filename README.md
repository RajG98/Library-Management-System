Here’s a sample `README.md` for your Library Management System project:

```markdown
# Library Management System

This is a full-stack Library Management System built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. It is designed to manage books, members, and issue records efficiently, with user authentication and role-based access control.

---

## Features

- **Backend**:
  - Built with **Spring Boot**.
  - Uses **Spring Security** for user and admin authentication.
  - Implements **CRUD operations** for Books, Members, and Issues.
  - Integrated with **MySQL** using **Spring Data JPA**.
  - Reduced boilerplate using **Lombok**.

- **Frontend**:
  - Developed using **React**.
  - Styled with **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
  - Handles API interactions using **Axios**.

- **Dockerized**:
  - Backend and MySQL are containerized for easy deployment.
  - Integrated with Docker Compose for simplified setup.

### Running the Project with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Backend: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Running Locally (Without Docker)

#### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Build the backend:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Configure the database in `application.yml`:
   ```yaml
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/digital_library
       username: your-mysql-username
       password: your-mysql-password
   ```

#### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
